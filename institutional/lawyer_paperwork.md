# PART I: EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

<a name="investment-offering"></a>

## 1. INVESTMENT OFFERING & STRATEGIC BRIEF

### MeetBarter - Unified Investment Offering & Protocol Strategic Brief

**Version**: 1.0 (Dispatch-Ready)  
**Date**: February 12, 2026  
**Confidentiality**: Strictly Private & Confidential

#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & MARKET OBJECT

The Lebanese economy and broader regional markets are facing unprecedented liquidity constraints. **MeetBarter** solves this by introducing a high-integrity, algorithmic peer-to-peer (P2P) barter protocol. We allow users to unlock the dormant value of their assets and skills through a non-monetary, trust-based ecosystem.

**The Opportunity**: Our platform is a **Technological Middleware** play. We automate the "Double Coincidence of Wants" in bartering using advanced categorization and a proprietary fairness protocol.

#### INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING & REGULATORY SHIELD

MeetBarter is structured to ensure absolute compliance and zero regulatory exposure.

* **Legal Identity**: MeetBarter SARL (Lebanese Limited Liability Company).
* **Regulatory Status**: A digital technology provider. We are NOT a financial institution, bank, or payment processor.
* **Internal Points (VP)**: Value Points are non-monetary, non-redeemable platform data units. They have no cash value and are not a currency.

#### STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE & COMPETITIVE MOAT

1. **Trust Verification Engine**: Multi-tiered verification (Community → Business → Legal) that creates a high-integrity swap environment.
2. **VP Fairness Protocol**: Algorithmic price capping based on item condition and origin to prevent inflation and ensure fairness.
3. **GeoDrop Gamification**: A hyper-local engagement engine that drives "Proof of Trust" interactions.

#### THE INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS

We offer two primary paths for participation in MeetBarter’s growth:

**A. Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE)**
Grants the investor rights to preferred equity in MeetBarter SARL upon a trigger event (Financing/Liquidity).

* **Target Participation**: Equity in the corporate entity and its technological IP.

**B. Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT)**
Grants the investor rights to future Value Points or successor protocol units.

* **Target Participation**: Utility growth of the P2P network.

#### REVENUE & SCALABILITY

1. **Subscription Tiering**: Access to higher listing limits and premium verification status.
2. **Hybrid Brokerage**: Small facilitation fees for "Cash-Sweetened" trades.
3. **Data Analytics**: Providing local supply/demand insights to institutional partners.

#### DUE-DILIGENCE & REGULATORY DEFENSE

Our legal architecture utilizes a "Narrow Object Clause" and "Linguistic Prohibition" doctrine to isolate the company from Central Bank (BDL) oversight. We operate as software middleware, which is a deregulated informational activity under the Lebanese Code of Commerce.

**CONTACT & INQUIRY**: To review the formal Articles of Association or request a Pitch Deck presentation, please contact the Manager.
