# MeetBarter Regulatory Shield Doctrine - v1.0

## 1. PURPOSE

To maintain a strict "Anti-Financial Classification Shield" by ensuring all platform terminology, operations, and external communications categorically exclude MeetBarter from the jurisdiction of the Central Bank of Lebanon (Banque du Liban) and financial oversight bodies.

## 2. CORE CATEGORICAL DEFINITION

MeetBarter is a **Technological Middleware Platform**. It provides information management systems for the facilitation of peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of non-fungible physical and digital assets.

**It is NOT a money transmitter, exchange office, or stored-value provider.**

## 3. LINGUISTIC PROHIBITIONS (The "Conviction-Avoidance" List)

The following terms are strictly prohibited in all code comments, marketing materials, and legal documents. Use the **Authorized Alternatives** only.

| PROHIBITED TERM | WHY? | AUTHORIZED ALTERNATIVE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Currency / Coin | Implies monetary status | "Exchange Unit" / "Point" |
| Wallet | Implies custody of funds | "Dashboard" / "Platform Account" |
| Deposit / Withdraw | Implies banking operations | "Import" / "Export" / "Point Loading" |
| Buy / Sell | Implies commercial sales | "Acquire" / "Barter" / "Exchange" |
| Payment / Transaction | Implies financial processing | "Facilitation" / "Point Transfer" |
| Token / Crypto | Invokes volatile asset regs | "Standardized Accounting Unit" |
| Stored Value | Invokes Law No. 133 | "Conditional Use Credits" |

## 4. VALUE POINT (VP) LEGAL NATURE

Value Points (VP) are defined as **Platform-Limited Proprietary Data Units**.

1. They have **NO intrinsic value**.
2. They are **NO redeemable for cash** from the Platform.
3. They represent a "Measurement of Effort" within the P2P community only.
4. The Platform does not guarantee liquidity or value retention.

## 5. REVENUE DEFINITION

Any fees collected (e.g., brokerage fees for cash-enabled hybrid exchanges) are **"Service Facilitation Fees"** for the use of the software, NOT "Transaction Percentages" or "Interest."

## 6. DISPUTE JURISDICTION

All facilitation happens "As-Is." The Platform is a "Bulletin Board with High-Integrity Verification Algorithms." It is not a party to the swap.
