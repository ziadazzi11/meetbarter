## 1. Executive Summary

This packet contains the foundational documents for the **MeetBarter** ecosystem, which operates under a **dual-entity structure**:

1. **MeetBarter Tech LLC (S.A.L.)**: A Lebanese Limited Liability Company responsible for technology development, IP ownership, and infrastructure.
2. **MeetBarter Foundation NGO**: A Lebanese Non-Governmental Organization responsible for community governance, social impact, and grant distribution.

The legal strategy relies on a **"Technological Middleware"** classification to remain distinct from financial institutions, as detailed in the *Regulatory Shield Doctrine*.
