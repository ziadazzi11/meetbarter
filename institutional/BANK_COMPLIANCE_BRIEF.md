## 2. Business Model (For Banking Compliance)

Our revenue model is transparent, low-risk, and standard for IT companies.

1. **Subscription Fees**: Users/Businesses pay a monthly fee for premium listing features and analytics (Standard SaaS model).
2. **Advertising & Sponsorships**: Local businesses pay to feature their products.
3. **Future Commission**: Only on *cash-settled* portions of trades, processed via standard regulated payment gateways (e.g., Visa/Mastercard via Stripe/FreshPay). **We do not hold user funds.**

### Operational Flow

* **User A** lists Apples.
* **User B** offers Fertilizer.
* **MeetBarter App** connects them via chat.
* **Result**: Users meet physically to swap goods. No money moves through our app for the swap itself.

## 3. Compliance & Risk Mitigation

To ensure we meet all Central Bank (BDL) and banking regulations:

* **No Custody of Funds**: MeetBarter does not hold, store, or transfer money between users. All monetary settlements (if any) happen directly between users or via licensed third-party processors.
* **"Value Points" (VP)**: The app uses an internal "score" (Value Points) to help users measure fairness. These are **Loyalty Points** (like Airline Miles), strictly non-redeemable for cash, and have zero monetary value outside the app.
* **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: We implement strict identity verification for all "Institutional Partners" (Farmers, Suppliers) to ensure legitimate business activity.

## 4. Strategic Focus: Agriculture & Food Security

Our pilot program focuses on the **Agricultural Sector** (The Lawyer's interest).

* **Goal**: Help farmers swap excess produce for essential supplies (fuel, seeds, labor) without needing immediate cash liquidity.
* **Social Impact**: Reduces food waste and supports the local real economy.

2. Payment of Government Fees (Registration, Taxes).
3. Receiving investment funds for software development costs (Salaries, Cloud Hosting).

**We welcome any further due diligence questions regarding our software architecture.**
