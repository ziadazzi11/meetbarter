# 📄 Meetbarter: Legal Positioning Statement (The Shield)

## For Banks, Regulators, and Institutional Partners

### ⚖️ Platform Nature

Meetbarter is a digital barter and trust coordination system. It facilitates the exchange of goods and services using internal **Value Points (VP)** that:

- Have no monetary value.
- Cannot be converted to cash.
- Cannot be purchased or sold.
- Exist only within the platform for internal accounting purposes.

### 🚫 What Value Points Are NOT

Value Points are not: **Currency, Electronic Money, Cryptocurrency, Securities, or Investment Products**. They represent relative exchange intensity inside a closed, trust-based network only.

### 🛡️ Institutional Separation

- **No Fiat ↔ VP Exchange**: Money is never exchanged for Value Points.
- **Operational Escrow**: Users pay an "Operational Coordination & Verification Escrow" to cover the cost of moderation and logistics.
- **Refund Policy**: Any unused portion of the operational escrow is automatically returned to the user, reinforcing that the platform does not skim value or monetize trades.
- **Voluntary Support**: Optional donations support NGO infrastructure and security but provide zero trade advantage or VP increases.

### 🗝️ One-Line Shield

> **"The platform charges for operational coordination services, not for value exchange or access to Value Points."**
