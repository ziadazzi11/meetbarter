# 📄 Meetbarter Global Foundation

## Board of Trustees & Humanitarian Oversight

### 🎯 Mission

To serve as the supreme governing body of the Meetbarter ecosystem, ensuring the platform never deviates from its humanitarian charter.

### 🏛️ Structure

The Foundation is managed by a Board of Directors derived from the 5 core executive roles (CTO, COO, Legal, Community, Moderation).

### 🗝️ Core Objectives

1. **The 6-Year Heartbeat**: Ensuring the platform remains active and that heir-succession protocols are functional.
2. **Grant Authorization**: Approving the release of funds from the 4% Emergency/Humanitarian Reserve.
3. **Institutional Trust**: Resolving high-level disputes and managing the "Keys of the Kingdom" (The 5 Heir Keys).

### 💼 Governance Protocols

- **Consensus**: Major system changes (e.g., fee adjustments) require a majority board vote.
- **Audit**: Reviewing the Audit Ledger monthly for non-repudiation.
