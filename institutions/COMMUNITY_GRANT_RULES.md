# 📄 Community Grant Pool & Professional Support Rules

## Ethical Distribution of Internal Surplus

### 🎯 Purpose

The Community Grant Pool exists to reward meaningful contribution and ensure platform continuity without monetization.

### 💰 Funding the Pool

1. **Operational Surplus**: Portions of the 10% Admin Fund that remain unused after infrastructure costs.
2. **External Sponsorships**: NGO-level grants (fiat) used to sponsor VP grants for specific vulnerable categories.
3. **Optional Support**: Voluntary donations from users believing in the mission.

### 🗝️ Distribution Principles

- **Locked for 30 Days**: All granted points are non-transferable for the first month to prevent immediate wash-trading.
- **Expiration**: Grants expire if unused within 90 days.
- **Audit-Linked**: Every grant must be linked to a specific justification (e.g., "Dispute Resolution Reward", "Emergency Service Provision").

### 🚫 Hard Rules

- **No Money for VP**: No user may ever receive VP directly or indirectly in exchange for money.
- **No Influence**: Donors have zero control over how or to whom grants are issued.
